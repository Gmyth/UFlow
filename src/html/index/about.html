                    &nbsp;&nbsp;It always be a painful time for you, an UB student, when you try to search and enroll courses on HUB for next semester. The HUB weekly schedule only can be seen after you enroll all the courses. In the other world, you have to memorize the course time or draw your schedule on paper to find out if there is a time conflict during your course searching process. So here we are! Our project Uplan is a dynamic course schedule builder which is designed for UB students. Our goal is to give UB students an easy way to build their course schedule. Students can build their schedule without worrying about checking time conflict which Uplan will do automatically. Meanwhile, they can leave comments and check others comments for any course. Searching and enrolling courses on HUB become extremely easy. You only need to search and enroll the specific courses after building your schedule on Uplan. Here are some instructions about how to use Uplan.
